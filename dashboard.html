    <h3>Disabled people profile</h3>

      <p>The first image is a dashboard of people with disabilities in Australia. There are two factors influencing the
        situation of disabled people in Australia, one is age and the other is gender. There are four sub-graphs in the
        dashboard, which are a bar chart with the distribution of persons with disabilities in different ages and
        genders, a bubble chart with age distribution characteristics, a pie chart with gender distribution
        characteristics, and age distribution characteristics. bar chart.</p>
      <p>The following information can be seen intuitively from the figure. First, people with disabilities exist in all
        age groups and genders. This means that when setting up web pages, businesses need to consider meeting the needs
        of all users. Second, the number of disabled people increases with age. This means that the elderly need more
        attention from enterprises, so the type and frequency of services need to be increased with age when setting up
        rescue activities. Finally, the proportion of disabled men and women is almost the same, so companies should not
        have any preference for gender.</p>

    <h3>Disabled people needed activities</h3>

    <div id="right">

      <img src="images/dashboard2.png" width="55%">

      <br></br>

      <p>The second image is a dashboard of types of disability assistance activities. Cognitive or emotional tasks,
        communication, health care, household chores, meal preparation, mobility, property maintenance, reading or
        writing tasks, self-care and transport are all assistance activities that people with disabilities need. There
        are two sub-graphs in the dashboard, one is a word cloud chart of the types of assistance activities that the
        disabled need, and the other is a chart of the proportion of the types of assistance activities that the
        disabled need.
      </p>
      <p>The following information can be seen intuitively from the figure. First of all, the relief activities that
        people with disabilities need are diverse, spanning medical, artistic, and community fields. Secondly, health
        care, cognitive or emotional tasks, and communication are the three activities with the highest proportion, so
        they should be paid attention to by enterprises, and enterprises should provide disabled people with priority
        and a large number of assistance activities related to these three aspects.

    <h3>Disabled people participation</h3>

    <div id="left">

      <img src="images/dashboard3.png" width="55%">

      <p>The third graph shows the types of daily activities that people with disabilities need. art or craft or
        practical hobby group activities, performing arts group activities, religious or spiritual group activities,
        sport or physical recreation with others, visited relatives or friends, voluntary or community service
        activities, went on holidays or camping with others, went out with relatives or friends are daily activities
        required by disabled people.
      </p>
      <p>This graph provides an overview of the needs of people of different ages for different daily activities. The
        following information can be seen intuitively from the figure. First, every age group has more or less needs for
        every activity. This means businesses need to target participants of all ages when planning their events.
        Second, different age groups have inconsistent needs for different activities. Although all three age groups
        preferred to visit relative or friends, they showed different rankings in each of the same activities.
