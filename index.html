    <p>There are about 4.3 million disabled people in Australia. The NDIS will fund supports and services for an
      estimated 500,000 Australians with permanent and substantial disabilities over the course of the following five
      years. Many people will be receiving the necessary disability help for the first time as a result.
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>National: All states and territories are gradually implementing the NDIS.
      </li>
      <li>Disability: The NDIS provides support to eligible people with intellectual, physical, sensory, cognitive and
        psychosocial disability. Early intervention supports can also be provided for eligible people with disability
        or children with developmental delay.
      </li>
      <li>Insurance: The NDIS gives all Australians peace of mind if they, their child or loved one is born with or
        acquires a permanent and significant disability, they will get the support they need.
      </li>
      <li>Scheme: The NDIS is not a welfare system. The NDIS is designed to help people get the support they need so
        their skills and independence improve over time.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h4>Aged Care</h4>

      <p>As you get older, living independently in your own home can become more difficult. If you’re finding it
        harder to do the things you used to, you can ask for some help.</p>
      <p>Maybe you need some help after a hospital stay, or support if your regular family carer is taking a holiday.
        Short-term care can help you cope with life’s interruptions.</p>
      <p>You might be at a stage where you no longer feel able to live independently at home, even with carer support
        or home care services to help you. If that’s the case, it may be time to consider moving into an aged care
        home.</p>
