    <h2>What I want?</h2>

    <p>I am a highly sensitive person. This sensitivity comes from my father's influence on me. My father was a doctor,
      and I knew from a young age that he had the power to save many lives. Whenever I listen to him tell the story of
      his healing, I find that I feel the pain of what I hear. Therefore, from a young age, I was inspired to help more
      people change their lives just like my father.</p>
    <p>When I came to Australia to study my master's degree, a chance volunteer opportunity brought me into contact with
      the NDIS program. Its goal is to lead vulnerable people to live a normal life. I've come to realize that there is
      a group that provides individualized support to people with disabilities in its own way. So, I decided to become
      one of the contributors to this project, hoping to do my part for those in need in the society.</p>
    <p>During my time in the NDIS Volunteer Program, I have been thinking about how I can use my strengths to achieve my
      aspirations. I have more than 6 years of professional background in information systems and more than 1 year of
      Internet internship experience. Therefore, the best way for me is to build a website for disabled people to help
      them find the information they need in a timely manner. This is the original intention of this website.</p>
    <p>My goal is to make more people aware of the existence of vulnerable people, empathize with them and give them
      more love through this personalized website. At the same time, I also call on more people who want to change
      people's lives to understand and join the NDIS project to provide higher quality services for people with
      disabilities, which is a meaningful and valuable thing.</p>
